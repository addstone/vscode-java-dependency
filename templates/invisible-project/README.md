Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

The workspace contains two folders by default, which:

- `src`: the folder to maintain srouces
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

You can also use the setting `java.dependency.referencedLibraries` to update your required dependencies.
